/// The bars are driven from `retile()`, which fires on every
/// structural, focus, mode and settings change — and a title
/// change is none of those. `TilingEngine.shouldRetile` returns
/// false for `.windowTitleChanged` deliberately (a title moves
/// no window), so before titles were drawable nothing needed to
/// happen and nothing did. Drawing a title makes the same event
/// a *render* input, so it needs this path — and needs it to
/// stay off the retile path, which would move windows for a
/// renamed tab.
///
/// Debounced, because the event is as fast as a keystroke: an
/// editor retitles as its dirty flag flips and a browser several
/// times through a page load. One refresh per quiet moment is
/// both cheaper and steadier to look at — an App Bar re-measures
/// its uniform slot against the widest title on every render
/// (`AppBarOverlay.autoSlotWidth`), so an undebounced burst would
/// visibly pump the slot widths while the user types.
///
/// It rides `DeferredTasks` rather than a flag plus a dispatch
/// hop: the reschedule-cancels-the-previous protocol IS the
/// debounce, and teardown's `cancelAll()` then reaches this the
/// same as every other settle — a hand-kept cancel list is how a
/// missing cancel slipped through review once already (#48).
