/// `scripts/build-app.sh`'s SDK stamp, held two ways (#1499).
///
/// SwiftPM under Xcode 27 stamps the deployment target as the
/// SDK, and AppKit draws the macOS 26 control design only for a
/// binary linked against SDK >= 26 — so a packaged build from
/// the wrong toolchain looks like a Settings regression and is
/// invisible to every test that runs the code. The script passes
/// the platform version explicitly and verifies the stamp after
/// the build; the scan clauses pin that SHAPE, and the spawned
/// clauses run the verification block itself against a real
/// Mach-O so the refusal is measured rather than read.
