/// Convention note: `.claude/rules/tests.md` prefers per-file
/// private helpers ("no shared test harness"). This file is the
/// second ratified exception, on the same terms as
/// `ReflectionParity.swift` — these are stateless mechanics
/// (spawn a process, drain its pipes, lay out a temp directory)
/// with no setup/teardown coupling and no assertions of their
/// own. The trigger was the #249 architect review on issue #252:
/// merge-keys' suite would have been the *fifth* hand-copied
/// spawn harness, so the copy was extracted here instead.
///
/// Two fixture shapes exist, and the split is **historical, not
/// fundamental** — `extract-keys` was wired for env overrides
/// before the copy-into-a-fixture technique existed, and the
/// repo-shaped form would serve it too:
///
/// - **Repo-shaped** (`rename-key`, `drop-key`, `merge-keys`):
///   the script derives its root from its own `__file__` and has
///   no env-var override, so the test copies the script into a
///   directory tree shaped like the real repo. Use
///   `makeRepoShapedFixture` + `runRepoScript`.
/// - **Env-var scoped** (`extract-keys`): the script honours
///   `KIWIDESK_EXTRACT_SOURCES` / `KIWIDESK_EXTRACT_LOCALES`, so
///   the real script runs in place against flat temp dirs. Use
///   `runPythonScript` directly with an `environment`.
///
/// Converging the two on the repo-shaped form would be a real
/// improvement — it exercises each script exactly as shipped,
/// and it would let the test-only env hooks be deleted from
/// production code. It would also make `extract-keys --site`
/// testable at all: `SITE_LOCALES_DIR` is `__file__`-derived
/// with no override, so site mode is unreachable under the
/// env-var shape today. Left as a follow-up rather than widened
/// into this change.
///
/// Only the spawn primitive is shared by both.

/// The repo root, derived from **this** file's location.
///
/// `#filePath` is used in the body, never as a default argument:
/// a defaulted `#filePath` expands at the *call site*, so a suite
/// added one directory deeper would silently resolve `Tests/` as
/// the repo root and fail on a confusing copy error.
