/// Every bar text field is placed through a named door (#1707): a
/// field whose line box is centred by hand looks right in the
/// system font — its ascent and descent nearly balance its caps —
/// and wrong in a tall face, so a behavioural suite that renders
/// the sites it knows cannot see a new one. The census counts each
/// text-field construction in `Sources/KiwiDeskCore/Bar`, per file,
/// against a register naming the door its placement takes and the
/// file that spells it, or the reason it takes none. The register
/// is the one copy of who is exempt.
///
/// Blind spot, stated: the door clause asks that the door is
/// spelled in the named file, not that every field of that file
/// reaches it, so a second field added beside one that does is
/// review's — the count moving is what brings it there.
