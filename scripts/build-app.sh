# Assemble KiwiDesk.app from the release build (#89).
#
# SwiftPM cannot emit an .app, so the bundle is assembled here.
# Everything the plist declares is derived, never re-typed: the
# version comes from KiwiDeskVersion.swift (the same constant
# `kiwidesk --version` prints) and the two icon keys come from
# actool's own partial plist. A second hand-maintained copy of
# either would be one more thing to forget on release day.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/build-app.sh [--identity <id>] [--notarize <profile>]
#                        [--output <dir>] [--skip-build] [--dmg]
#                        [--zip]
#
#   --identity   Signing identity. Omit it and the sole
#                "Developer ID Application" identity in the
#                keychain is used, falling back to "-" (ad-hoc)
#                when there is none — so this needs no argument
#                on a release machine nor on a contributor's.
#                Ad-hoc works with no Apple account, but its code
#                identity IS the binary hash, so macOS treats
#                every rebuild as a different app and the
#                Accessibility grant resets each time. Any stable
#                certificate (a self-signed one is enough) keeps
#                the grant across rebuilds; a Developer ID
#                identity is the one that can also be notarized
#                for distribution.
#   --notarize   Submit to Apple and staple, using a notarytool
#                keychain profile you created yourself with
#                `xcrun notarytool store-credentials`. Requires a
#                Developer ID identity. This script never handles
#                your credentials — it only names the profile.
#   --dmg        Also wrap the finished bundle in a disk image for
#                the website download. The Homebrew cask installs
#                from a .zip and never needs this. Combine with
#                --notarize: the disk image is a separate piece of
#                signed code and needs its own ticket (see step 7).
#   --zip        Also archive the finished bundle for the Homebrew
#                cask and the release upload (#32, #105). Built
#                after step 6 so the app inside is already
#                stapled — see step 8 for why the archive itself
#                neither can nor should carry a ticket.

Assemble KiwiDesk.app from the release build (#89).

Usage: scripts/build-app.sh [options]

  --identity <id>    Signing identity. Omit to use the sole
                     "Developer ID Application" in the keychain,
                     falling back to "-" (ad-hoc) when none.
  --notarize <prof>  Submit to Apple and staple, via a notarytool
                     keychain profile (needs a Developer ID).
  --output <dir>     Where to write the bundle (default .build/app).
  --skip-build       Reuse the existing release build.
  --dmg              Also wrap the bundle in a disk image.
  --zip              Also archive the bundle (cask / release).
  --allow-no-icon    Proceed even if actool cannot compile the icon.
  -h, --help         Show this help and exit.

# target. The ticket therefore travels on the .app INSIDE, which
# is why this runs after step 6 and refuses to build otherwise.
